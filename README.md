## Background

FOXy is a proposed staking rewards system that allows FOX token holders the ability to stake FOX into a smart contract in order to receive rewards denominated in FOXy. FOXy is an ERC20, rebasing token that is redeemable 1:1 with FOX tokens. The FOX rewards generated by the staking system are provided to the contract via the Shapeshift DAO’s treasury swapping for Tokemak’s TOKE rewards, but this project aims to provide a design that is extensible in the future for other alternative yield generating strategies. The ultimate goal is for FOX holders to have a simplified interface in which to earn yield on their FOX tokens that outperforms other avenues available to them without active management.

### Run Tests

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn compile`
3. `yarn test` or `yarn coverage` will run the basic test examples.

### Other Commands

`yarn local-node` - used to run your own forked mainnet node locally

`yarn local-init` - used to initialize local-node and set up the FOXy contracts to use locally

`yarn local-mine` - used to mine to the next Tokemak cycle as well as sendWithdrawalRequests and rebase
